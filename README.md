# Eeveelections

Eeveelections is a collector first Pokémon card marketplace built on a simple principle: what you see is exactly what you get. Every card listed is photographed individually, presented without filters or manipulation, and sold exactly as shown. No surprises, no misleading angles, just an honest presentation and transparency.

We focus on singles because that’s where trust matters most. The condition, centering, edges, print quality that all collectors deserve to see before making a purchase. Our storefront is designed around that promise: clear listings, accurate images, and straightforward pricing grounded in fairness.

Eeveelections is starting small, but the vision is steady. As we grow, we plan to expand our offerings while maintaining the same collector-focused standards that define us. This brand was created for people who genuinely care about the cards they purchase, and everything we build is shaped around respecting that experience.

## Mission Statement
To create a transparent, honest, and collector driven Pokemon card marketplace where every listing reflects the exact card being sold, every price is fair, and every collector knows they’re getting the truth not a marketing angle.

## Core Values
- **Transparency:** The photos you see are the card you receive.
- **Fair Pricing:** We prioritize reasonable, market aligned pricing without predatory markups.
- **Collector-First:** Every decision is shaped around the needs of genuine collectors.
- **Trust by Design:** Our brand is built on clarity, honesty, and consistency.
